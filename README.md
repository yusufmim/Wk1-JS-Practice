My Week 1 Javascript Challenges Project
Welcome to my Week 1 JavaScript Challenges project! This is a fun little collection of toy problems that I worked on to practice and improve my JavaScript skills. The project includes three different challenges, each with a unique task to solve. Let's dive in!

# Overview
This project contains three mini-projects that each solve a specific problem:

# Student Grade Generator – A program that takes student marks and generates a grade.

# Speed Detector – A program that calculates demerit points based on a car’s speed.

# Net Salary Calculator – A program that calculates an individual’s net salary after deductions.

These challenges are perfect for practicing basic JavaScript concepts, such as conditional statements, functions, and user input handling.

# Challenges
 # Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
This challenge asks you to input a student's marks, and the program will return their grade based on the following scale:

A: Above 79

B: Between 60 and 79

C: Between 49 and 59

D: Between 40 and 49

E: Below 40

You enter the marks, and the program will tell you the corresponding grade.

How it works:
The program takes a number input between 0 and 100.

It checks the range of that number and displays the appropriate grade.

# Challenge 2: Speed Detector
In this challenge, you enter the speed of a car, and the program will check if it’s over the speed limit (70 km/h). If it is, it will calculate demerit points for every 5 km/s over the limit. If the driver gets more than 12 points, their license is suspended.

How it works:
Enter the car speed.

If the speed is greater than 70 km/h, the program calculates the demerit points.

For every 5 km/h over the limit, 1 point is added.

If the total points exceed 12, it prints a message saying the license is suspended.

# Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
This challenge is a little more advanced. It takes the basic salary and benefits of an individual and calculates the net salary after deductions such as PAYE (tax), NHIF, NSSF, and housing levy. It’s based on real-life deductions in Kenya, with some customizable parameters to reflect the current tax year.

How it works:
Enter the basic salary and benefits.

The program calculates deductions like PAYE (tax), NHIF (Health Insurance), NSSF (Pension Fund), and housing levy.

Finally, it provides the gross salary, total deductions, and net salary.

How to Use
To run any of these challenges:

Clone this repository:

# git clone https://github.com/yusufmim/Wk1-JS-Practice

Open the files:

Navigate to the project directory and open the HTML file in your web browser.

Interact with the Programs:

For the grade generator, enter the marks, and it will display the grade.

For the speed detector, input the speed of a car, and it will calculate points.

For the salary calculator, enter the salary and benefits to see the net salary after deductions.
